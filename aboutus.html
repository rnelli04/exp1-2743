                    <h3><u>History</u></h3>
    <p>
        The Indian Premier League (IPL) was founded in 2008 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 
        It was the brainchild of Lalit Modi, the then-vice president of the BCCI. The league was created to bring 
        a festive atmosphere to the sport of cricket, combining high-octane T20 action with Bollywood glamour and 
        world-class entertainment.
        <br><br>
        The first tournament was won by the Rajasthan Royals in 2008. Since then, the IPL has grown to become the 
        richest and most popular cricket league in the world, surpassing many major global sports leagues in terms 
        of brand value and viewership.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Organization</u></h3>
        <p>
            The IPL is organized by the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India). The league is governed
            by the IPL Governing Council, which is responsible for all tournament functions, including the 
            player auction, schedule, and rules.
